0. I used gdb to run ./0, and use "start" then the secret shows up
1. I start with run ltrace ./1, then I convert the rand return value from hexadecimal number to decimal number and that is the passcode for the secrect. 
2. I start to run ltrace ./2, I got the return value is 0 and I look up libcurl error codes, I found out that CURLE_OK has return value 0, so CURLE_OK is the secret.
3. First I start with run ./3, then I got a error message says no such file found, then I run ltrace ./3, the function _xstat() return value is -1, that means the function failed and I found that the file name is "iamspecial", and i create a iamspecial file. I run ./3 again, I got "checking for appropriate access rights", then I run ls .l to check the permission of file, so I use chmod g+x iamspecial give group executable to the file and use chmod u+xr iamapecial give the user readable and executable to the file. Finally I run ./3 again, the secret shows up.
4. I start with running ./4, I got a message says "error while loading shared libraries: lib361.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory", so I start to run command export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/hw2-xwu82 and I create 3 files are abc.c, abc.h and main.c, after I create 3 files I start to write function to link all three function. and I start to run these command “gcc -c -Wall -Werror -fpic abc.c”，“gcc -shared -o lib361.so abc.o” and "gcc -Wall -o test main.c" to complie the code. And run "ltrace ./4" it found a function called "secretoperation", then I change my function name to "secretoperation" and recompile the code, use ltrace ./4 again, I found that the return value is 10, Finally I change my function return value to 10, then I recomplie again and I found the secret.
